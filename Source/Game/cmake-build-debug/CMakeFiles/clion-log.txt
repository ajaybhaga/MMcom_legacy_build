CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:29 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindUrho3D.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Urho3D", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Urho3D" with any
  of the following names:

    Urho3DConfig.cmake
    urho3d-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Urho3D" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Urho3D_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Urho3D"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.


CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No cmake_minimum_required command is present.  A line of code such as

    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.21)

  should be added at the top of the file.  The version specified may be lower
  if you wish to support older CMake versions for this project.  For more
  information run "cmake --help-policy CMP0000".
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
